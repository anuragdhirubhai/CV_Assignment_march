# CV_Assignment_march
This is the final assignment of computer vision, in this I have collected images of my hand to train the the model for gesture recognition, here we are using sign for 'a', 'b',
'c', '1','2' and '3'.
I have used cv2 and handgesture control module to collect images and google train machine to train the model which i later extracted from there.
No. of images for every letter and no. is around 400 for training, due to size constraint I have uploaded only 14 each in this repository.
